Writing this documentation
==========================

Although each of the Kurento repositories contains a *README* file, the main source of truth for up-to-date information about Kurento is *this* documentation you are reading right now, hosted at Read the Docs.

The final deliverable form of the documentation is obtained by following a 3-step process:

1. Documentation sources are written in a markup language called `reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html>`__ (or **reST**, for short). This format is less known that the popular `Markdown <https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/>`__, but it is much more powerful and adequate for long-form documentation writing.

   The *reST* language itself can be learned from pages such as the `Sphinx guide to reStructuredText <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/index.html>`__ of the official `Quick reStructuredText <https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html>`__ reference.

2. The *reST* source files are processed and converted to other deliverable formats (such as HTML or PDF) by `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`__, a documentation processing tool.

3. Finally, the generated files are hosted in `Read the Docs <https://docs.readthedocs.io/>`__, the service of choice for lots of Open Source projects. Actually Read the Docs is not only the hosting, but they also perform the Sphinx generation step itself: they have a Continuous Integration system that watches our Git repository and triggers a new documentation build each time a change is pushed.

Sphinx is able to extend the core *reST* language by means of *extensions*, and we use some of them:

* `sphinx.ext.extlinks <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/3.x/usage/extensions/extlinks.html>`__, to easily provide links to external sites (currently for the `English Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/>`__).
* `sphinx.ext.graphviz <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/3.x/usage/extensions/graphviz.html>`__, to embed `Graphviz <https://graphviz.org/>`__ DOT diagrams.
* `sphinx.ext.ifconfig <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/3.x/usage/extensions/ifconfig.html>`__, to conditionally build different blocks into the documentation.



Building locally
================

If you are writing documentation for Kurento, there is no need to commit every change and push to see the result only to discover that an image doesn't show up as you expected, or some small mistake breaks a table layout.

First of all, it's a very good idea to use a text editor that provides spell checking and live-preview visualization of *reST* files; this alone will help catching most grammatical and syntactic mistakes. `Visual Studio Code <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__ is a great option, it provides extensions for both of these things.

To install the two mentioned features for *VSCode*, run these commands:

.. code-block:: console

   code --install-extension streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker
   code --install-extension lextudio.restructuredtext

To install Sphinx, first ensure that your system has Python 3 and the *pip* installer available. Do not run this command if you know that your system is already configured with these tools:

.. code-block:: console

   # Install Python 3 and the pip installer
   sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends --yes \
       python3 python3-pip

Also optionally, make a bit of cleanup in case old versions were installed:

.. code-block:: console

   # Ensure that old versions of Sphinx are not installed
   sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove --yes \
       '^python-sphinx.*' \
       '^python3-sphinx.*' \
       '^sphinx.*'

   pip3 freeze | grep -i '^sphinx' | xargs sudo -H pip3 uninstall --yes

And finally, perform the installation:

.. code-block:: console

   # Install Sphinx and the Read the Docs theme
   sudo -H pip3 install --upgrade -r requirements.txt

Now just run ``make html`` inside the documentation directory, and open the newly built files with a web browser:

.. code-block:: console

   cd doc-kurento/
   make html
   firefox build/html/index.html



Kurento documentation Style Guide
=================================

Paragraph conventions
---------------------

* **Line breaks**: *Don't* break the lines. The documentation is a prose text, and not source code, so the typical restrictions of line length don't apply here. Use automatic line breaks in your editor, if you want. The overall flow of the text should be dictated by the width of the screen where the text is being presented, and not by some arbitrary line length limit.



Inline markup
-------------

* File names, package names, variable names, class and event names, (mostly all kinds of names), acronyms, commit hashes, and in general any kind of identifier which could be broken into different lines are emphasized with single asterisks (as in ``*word*``). Sample phrases:

  .. code-block:: text

     This document talks about Kurento Media Server (*KMS*).
     All dependency targets are defined in the *CMakeLists.txt* file.
     You need to install *libboost-dev* for development.
     Enable debug by setting the *GST_DEBUG* environment variable.

* Paths, URLs, code samples, commands, and in general any machine-oriented keywords are emphasized with double back quotes (as in ````word````). This formatting stands out, and most importantly *it cannot be broken into different lines*. Sample phrases:

  .. code-block:: text

     Use ``apt-get install`` to set up all required packages.
     Set ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`` to build with debug symbols.
     The argument ``--gst-debug`` can be used to control the logging level.

* There is no difference between using *single asterisks* (``*word*``), and `single back quotes` (```word```); they get rendered as *italic text*. So, always use asterisks when wanting to emphasize some text.

* As opposed to Markdown, underscores (as in ``_word_``) *don't get rendered*, so don't use them to emphasize text.



Header conventions
------------------

* **Header separation**: Always separate each header from the preceding paragraph, by using **3** empty lines. The only exception to this rule is when two headers come together (e.g. a document title followed by a section title); in that case, they are separated by just **1** empty line.

* **Header shape**: *reST* allows to express section headers with any kind of characters that form an underline shape below the section title. We follow these conventions for Kurento documentation files:

  1. Level 1 (Document title). Use ``=`` above and below:

  .. code-block:: text

        =======
        Level 1
        =======

  2. Level 2. Use ``=`` below:

  .. code-block:: text

        Level 2
        =======

  3. Level 3. Use ``-``:

  .. code-block:: text

        Level 3
        -------

  4. Level 4. Use ``~``:

  .. code-block:: text

        Level 4
        ~~~~~~~

  5. Level 5. Use ``"``:

  .. code-block:: text

        Level 5
        """""""



Sphinx documentation generator
==============================

Our Sphinx-based project is hosted in the `doc-kurento <https://github.com/Kurento/doc-kurento>`__ repository. Here, the main entry point for running Sphinx is the Makefile, based on the template that is provided for new projects by Sphinx itself. This Makefile is customized to attend our particular needs, and implements several targets:

* **init-workdir**. This target constitutes the first step to be run before most other targets. Our documentation source files contain substitution keywords in some parts, in the form ``| KEYWORD |``, which is expected to be substituted by some actual value during the generation process. Currently, the only keyword in use is ``VERSION``, which must be expanded to the actual version of the documentation being built.

  For example, here is the *VERSION_KMS* keyword when substituted with its final value: ``6.15.0``.

  .. note::

     Sphinx already includes a substitutions feature by itself, for the keywords ``version`` and ``release``.  Sadly, this feature of Sphinx is very unreliable. For example, it won't work if the keyword is located inside a literal code block, or inside an URL. So, we must resort to performing the substitutions by ourselves during a pre-processing step, if we want reliable results.

  The way this works is that the *source* folder gets copied into the *build* directory, and then the substitutions take place over this copy.

* **langdoc**. This target creates the automatically generated reference documentation for each :doc:`/features/kurento_client`. Currently, this means the Javadoc and Jsdoc documentations for Java and Js clients, respectively. The Kurento client repositories are checked out in the same version as specified by the documentation version file, or in the master branch if no such version tag exists. Then, the client stubs of the :doc:`/features/kurento_api` are automatically generated, and from the resulting source files, the appropriate documentation is automatically generated too.

  The *langdoc* target is usually run before the *html* target, in order to end up with a complete set of HTML documents that include all the reST documentation with the Javadoc/Jsdoc sections.

* **dist**. This target is a convenience shortcut to generate the documentation in the most commonly requested formats: HTML, PDF and EPUB. All required sub-targets will be run and the resulting files will be left as a compressed package in the ``dist/`` subdir.

* **ci-readthedocs**. This is a special target that is meant to be called exclusively by our Continuous Integration system. The purpose of this job is to manipulate all the documentation into a state that is a valid input for the Read the Docs CI system. Check the next section for more details.



Read the Docs builds
====================

It would be great if Read the Docs worked by simply calling the command *make html*, as then we would be able to craft a Makefile that would build the complete documentation in one single step (by making the Sphinx's *html* target dependent on our *init-workdir* and *langdoc*). But alas, they don't work like this; instead, they run Sphinx directly from their Python environment, rendering our Makefile as useless in their CI.

In order to overcome this limitation, we opted for the simple solution of handling RTD a specifically-crafted Git repository, with the contents that they expect to find. This works as follows:

1. Read the Docs has been configured to watch for changes in the `doc-kurento-readthedocs`_ repo, instead of *doc-kurento*.
2. The *init-workdir* and *langdoc* targets run locally from our *doc-kurento* repo.
3. The resulting files from those targets are copied as-is to the *doc-kurento-readthedocs* repository.
4. Everything is then committed and pushed to this latter repo, thus triggering a new RTD build.

robots.txt
----------

Read the Docs allows setting up a custom **robots.txt**, which we can use to prevent search engines from scrapping old and deprecated versions of the documentation, giving instead full priority to the ``/latest/`` and ``/stable/`` subdirectories in search engines:

* `How can I avoid search results having a deprecated version of my docs? <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/faq.html#how-can-i-avoid-search-results-having-a-deprecated-version-of-my-docs>`__.
* `Custom robots.txt Pages <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/hosting.html#custom-robots-txt-pages>`__.

This is exactly the behavior we want, because without it, searches like "kurento webrtc" would show results from old 6.9 or 6.10 pages, while we'd rather have the latest or stable versions appearing.
