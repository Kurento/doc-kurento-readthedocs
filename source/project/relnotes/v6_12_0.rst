=====================
6.12.0 (October 2019)
=====================

Kurento Media Server **6.12** has been released!

To install it: :doc:`/user/installation`.

Added
=====

- Added support for the empty candidate that Firefox sends to signal the end of Trickle ICE.
- Resolve mDNS candidate names that Chrome uses in place of local candidate IP Addresses for privacy reasons.
- New package *kurento-dbg*, that installs all optional debugging symbols that are needed for Kurento crash reports.
- Add support for compilation with **Clang** and **UndefinedSanitizer** in the Kurento helper build script: `Kurento/kms-omni-build/bin/kms-build-run.sh <https://github.com/Kurento/kms-omni-build/blob/master/bin/kms-build-run.sh>`__.

Changed
=======

- *libsrtp* fork updated to version 1.6.0; custom patch reviewed to fix "***unprotect failed code 9***" warning messages.
- User **kurento** gets now created with an User ID belonging to the *system* category (which gets an UID >= 100), instead of the *user* category (which gets an UID >= 1000). This fixes the issue of the user *kurento* showing up in the Ubuntu login screen.
- The home directory for the user *kurento* has been moved from **/var/kurento** to **/var/lib/kurento**, which complies with the Linux Foundation's *Filesystem Hierarchy Standard* (FHS).
- Enable C++14 language spec. when building C++ code.

Deprecated
==========

- The old home directory for the user *kurento*, which was located at */var/kurento*, is now re-created as a symbolic link to the new location in */var/lib/kurento*. **Applications should migrate to the new location**. The next major release of Kurento will stop providing the fallback link in the old path.
