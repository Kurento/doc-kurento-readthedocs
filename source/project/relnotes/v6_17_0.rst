===================
6.17.0 (March 2022)
===================

This is a very small release, made to incorporate the ability to inherit new modules from *RtpEndpoint*.

To install Kurento Media Server: :doc:`/user/installation`.



Changed
=======

Inheritable RtpEndpoint
-----------------------

The Kurento *RtpEndpoint* classes were *final*, meaning that it was not possible to inherit from them in order to create new, specialized versions of the endpoint. This was a problem for the fellow contributors at `Naeva Tec <https://www.naevatec.com/>`__, who were trying to write `SipRtpEndpoint <https://github.com/naevatec/kms-siprtpendpoint>`__, a new endpoint that contains specific behaviors to make it work well with SIP communications.

This limitation got solved in this release. With the reorganization of several classes and introduction of a new internal library for the *RtpEndpoint*, it can now be inherited to create new classes based on it.

Thanks to `@slabajo <https://github.com/slabajo>`__ (Sa√∫l Labajo) for `Kurento/kms-elements#32 <https://github.com/Kurento/kms-elements/pull/32>`__ (*prepare for siprtp_module*) and `Kurento/kms-elements#33 <https://github.com/Kurento/kms-elements/pull/33>`__ (*RtpEndpoint library*).
