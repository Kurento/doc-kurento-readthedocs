JavaScript Module - Chroma Filter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application consists on a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*) with a chroma filter element.

.. note::

   This tutorial has been configurated for using https. Follow these `instructions </features/security.html#configure-javascript-applications-to-use-https>`_ 
   for securing your application.

For the impatient: running this example
=======================================

First of all, you should install Kurento Media Server to run this demo. Please
visit the :doc:`installation guide </user/installation>` for further
information. In addition, the built-in module ``kms-chroma`` should be also
installed:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo apt-get install kms-chroma

Be sure to have installed `Node.js`:term: and `Bower`:term: in your system. In
an Ubuntu machine, you can install both as follows:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g bower

Due to `Same-origin policy`:term:, this demo has to be served by an HTTP server.
A very simple way of doing this is by means of an HTTP Node.js server which can
be installed using `npm`:term: :

.. sourcecode:: bash

   sudo npm install http-server -g

You also need the source code of this demo. You can clone it from GitHub. Then
start the HTTP server:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-js/kurento-chroma
    git checkout 6.7.2-dev
    bower install
    http-server -p 8443 -S -C keys/server.crt -K keys/server.key

Finally, access the application connecting to the URL https://localhost:8443/
through a WebRTC capable browser (Chrome, Firefox).

.. note::

   These instructions work only if Kurento Media Server is up and running in the same machine
   as the tutorial. Kurento Media Server must use WebSockets over SSL/TLS (WSS), so make sure
   you check `this <../../faq.html?highlight=wss#configure-kurento-media-server-to-use-secure-websocket-wss>`_ too. 
   It is possible to locate the KMS in other machine simple adding the parameter ``ws_uri`` to the URL:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ws_uri=wss://kms_host:kms_port/kurento

   Notice that the Kurento Media Server must connected using a **Secure WebSocket** (i.e., the KMS URI
   starts with *wss://*). For this reason, the support for secure WebSocket must be enabled in the Kurento
   Media Server you are using to run this tutorial. For further information about securing applications,
   please visit the following :doc:`page </features/security>`.

Understanding this example
==========================

This application uses computer vision and augmented reality techniques to detect
a chroma in a WebRTC stream based on color tracking.

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one for the video camera stream (the local client-side stream) and
other for the mirror (the remote stream). The video camera stream is sent to
Kurento Media Server, which processes and sends it back to the client as a
remote stream. To implement this, we need to create a `Media Pipeline`:term:
composed by the following `Media Element`:term: s:

.. figure:: ../../images/kurento-module-tutorial-chroma-pipeline.png
   :align:   center
   :alt:     WebRTC with Chroma filter Media Pipeline

   *WebRTC with Chroma filter Media Pipeline*

The complete source code of this demo can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-java/tree/master/kurento-chroma>`_.

This example is a modified version of the
:doc:`Magic Mirror <./tutorial-magicmirror>` tutorial. In this case, this
demo uses a **Chroma** instead of **FaceOverlay** filter.

In order to perform chroma detection, there must be a color calibration stage.
To accomplish this step, at the beginning of the demo, a little square appears
in upper left of the video, as follows:

.. figure:: ../../images/kurento-module-tutorial-chroma-screenshot-01.png
   :align:   center
   :alt:     Chroma calibration stage

   *Chroma calibration stage*

In the first second of the demo, a calibration process is done, by detecting the
color inside that square. When the calibration is finished, the square
disappears and the chroma is substituted with the configured image. Take into
account that this process requires lighting condition. Otherwise the chroma
substitution will not be perfect. This behavior can be seen in the upper right
corner of the following screenshot:

   *Chroma filter in action*
   
.. note::

   Modules can have options. For configure these options, you need get the constructor to them.
   In Javascript and Node, you have to use *kurentoClient.getComplexType('qualifiedName')* . There is 
   an example in the code.

The media pipeline of this demo is is implemented in the JavaScript logic as
follows:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    ...
    kurentoClient.register('kurento-module-chroma')
    const WindowParam = kurentoClient.getComplexType('chroma.WindowParam')
    ...

    kurentoClient(args.ws_uri, function(error, client) {
      if (error) return onError(error);

      client.create('MediaPipeline', function(error, _pipeline) {
        if (error) return onError(error);

        pipeline = _pipeline;

        console.log("Got MediaPipeline");

        pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', function(error, webRtc) {
          if (error) return onError(error);

          setIceCandidateCallbacks(webRtcPeer, webRtc, onError)

          webRtc.processOffer(sdpOffer, function(error, sdpAnswer) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("SDP answer obtained. Processing...");

            webRtc.gatherCandidates(onError);
            webRtcPeer.processAnswer(sdpAnswer);
          });

          console.log("Got WebRtcEndpoint");

          var options =
          {
            window: WindowParam({
              topRightCornerX: 5,
              topRightCornerY: 5,
              width: 30,
              height: 30
            })
          }

          pipeline.create('chroma.ChromaFilter', options, function(error, filter) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("Got Filter");

            filter.setBackground(args.bg_uri, function(error) {
              if (error) return onError(error);

              console.log("Set Image");
            });

            client.connect(webRtc, filter, webRtc, function(error) {
              if (error) return onError(error);

              console.log("WebRtcEndpoint --> filter --> WebRtcEndpoint");
            });
          });
        });
      });
    });

.. note::

   The :term:`TURN` and :term:`STUN` servers to be used can be configured simple adding
   the parameter ``ice_servers`` to the application URL, as follows:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"stun:stun1.example.net"},{"urls":"stun:stun2.example.net"}]
      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"turn:turn.example.org","username":"user","credential":"myPassword"}]
