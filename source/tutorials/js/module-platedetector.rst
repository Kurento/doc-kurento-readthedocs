JavaScript Module - Plate Detector Filter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application consists on a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*) with a plate detector filter element.

.. note::

   This tutorial has been configurated for using https. Follow these `instructions </features/security.html#configure-javascript-applications-to-use-https>`_ 
   for securing your application.

For the impatient: running this example
=======================================

First of all, you should install Kurento Media Server to run this demo. Please
visit the :doc:`installation guide </user/installation>` for further
information. In addition, the built-in module ``kms-platedetector`` should
be also installed:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo apt-get install kms-platedetector

.. warning::

   Plate detector module is a prototype and its results is not
   always accurate. Consider this if you are planning to use this
   module in a production environment.

Be sure to have installed `Node.js`:term: and `Bower`:term: in your system. In
an Ubuntu machine, you can install both as follows:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g bower

Due to `Same-origin policy`:term:, this demo has to be served by an HTTP server.
A very simple way of doing this is by means of an HTTP Node.js server which can
be installed using `npm`:term: :

.. sourcecode:: bash

   sudo npm install http-server -g

You also need the source code of this demo. You can clone it from GitHub. Then
start the HTTP server:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-js/kurento-platedetector
    git checkout 6.7.2-dev
    bower install
    http-server -p 8443 -S -C keys/server.crt -K keys/server.key

Finally, access the application connecting to the URL https://localhost:8443/
through a WebRTC capable browser (Chrome, Firefox).

.. note::

   These instructions work only if Kurento Media Server is up and running in the same machine
   as the tutorial. Kurento Media Server must use WebSockets over SSL/TLS (WSS), so make sure
   you check `this <../../faq.html?highlight=wss#configure-kurento-media-server-to-use-secure-websocket-wss>`_ too. 
   It is possible to locate the KMS in other machine simple adding the parameter ``ws_uri`` to the URL:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ws_uri=wss://kms_host:kms_port/kurento

   Notice that the Kurento Media Server must connected using a **Secure WebSocket** (i.e., the KMS URI
   starts with *wss://*). For this reason, the support for secure WebSocket must be enabled in the Kurento
   Media Server you are using to run this tutorial. For further information about securing applications,
   please visit the following :doc:`page </features/security>`.

Understanding this example
==========================

This application uses computer vision and augmented reality techniques to detect
a plate in a WebRTC stream on optical character recognition (OCR).

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one for the video camera stream (the local client-side stream) and
other for the mirror (the remote stream). The video camera stream is sent to
Kurento Media Server, which processes and sends it back to the client as a
remote stream. To implement this, we need to create a `Media Pipeline`:term:
composed by the following `Media Element`:term: s:

   *WebRTC with plateDetector filter Media Pipeline*

The complete source code of this demo can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-java/tree/master/kurento-platedetector>`_.

This example is a modified version of the
:doc:`Magic Mirror <./tutorial-magicmirror>` tutorial. In this case, this
demo uses a **PlateDetector** instead of **FaceOverlay** filter. An screenshot
of the running example is shown in the following picture:

   *Plate detector demo in action*

.. note::

   Modules can have options. For configuring these options, you'll need to get the constructor for them.
   In Javascript and Node, you have to use *kurentoClient.getComplexType('qualifiedName')* . There is 
   an example in the code.

The following snippet shows how the media pipeline is implemented in the Java
server-side code of the demo. An important issue in this code is that a
listener is added to the ``PlateDetectorFilter`` object
(``addPlateDetectedListener``). This way, each time a plate is detected in the
stream, a message is sent to the client side. As shown in the screenshot below,
this event is printed in the console of the GUI.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    ...
    kurentoClient.register('kurento-module-platedetector')
    ...
    
    kurentoClient(args.ws_uri, function(error, client) {
      if (error) return onError(error);

      client.create('MediaPipeline', function(error, _pipeline) {
        if (error) return onError(error);

        pipeline = _pipeline;

        console.log("Got MediaPipeline");

        pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', function(error, webRtc) {
          if (error) return onError(error);

          console.log("Got WebRtcEndpoint");

          setIceCandidateCallbacks(webRtcPeer, webRtc, onError)

          webRtc.processOffer(sdpOffer, function(error, sdpAnswer) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("SDP answer obtained. Processing...");

            webRtc.gatherCandidates(onError);
            webRtcPeer.processAnswer(sdpAnswer);
          });

          pipeline.create('platedetector.PlateDetectorFilter', function(error, filter) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("Got Filter");

            filter.on('PlateDetected', function (data){
              console.log("License plate detected " + data.plate);
            });

            client.connect(webRtc, filter, webRtc, function(error) {
              if (error) return onError(error);

              console.log("WebRtcEndpoint --> filter --> WebRtcEndpoint");
            });
          });
        });
      });
    });

.. note::

   The :term:`TURN` and :term:`STUN` servers to be used can be configured simple adding
   the parameter ``ice_servers`` to the application URL, as follows:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"stun:stun1.example.net"},{"urls":"stun:stun2.example.net"}]
      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"turn:turn.example.org","username":"user","credential":"myPassword"}]
