JavaScript Module - Plate Detector Filter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application consists of a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*) with a plate detector filter element.



Running this example
====================

First of all, install Kurento Media Server: :doc:`/user/installation`. Start the media server and leave it running in the background.

.. note::

   If you will run this tutorial from a remote machine (i.e. not from ``localhost``), then **you need to configure Secure WebSocket (wss://) in Kurento Media Server**. For instructions, check :ref:`features-security-kms-wss`.

   This is not an issue if you will run both KMS and the tutorial demo locally, because browsers (at least Chrome at the time of this writing) allow connecting to insecure WebSockets from HTTPS pages, as long as everything happens in ``localhost``.

Install :term:`Node.js`, :term:`Bower`, and a web server in your system:

.. code-block:: bash

   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g bower
   sudo npm install -g http-server

Here, we suggest using the simple Node.js ``http-server``, but you could use any other web server.

.. note::

   You need to configure the web server with HTTPS. For more information, check :ref:`features-security-js-https`.

You also need the source code of this demo; clone it from GitHub, then start the web server:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-js/kurento-platedetector
    git checkout 6.11.0
    bower install
    http-server -p 8443 --ssl --cert keys/server.crt --key keys/server.key

Finally, access the web application by using a WebRTC-capable browser (Firefox, Chrome) to open the appropriate URL:

* If KMS is running in your local machine:

  .. code-block:: text

     https://localhost:8443/

* If KMS is running in a remote server:

  .. code-block:: text

     https://localhost:8443/index.html?ws_uri=wss://<KmsIp>:<KmsPort>/kurento



Understanding this example
==========================

This application uses computer vision and augmented reality techniques to detect
a plate in a WebRTC stream on optical character recognition (OCR).

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one for the video camera stream (the local client-side stream) and
other for the mirror (the remote stream). The video camera stream is sent to
Kurento Media Server, which processes and sends it back to the client as a
remote stream. To implement this, we need to create a `Media Pipeline`:term:
composed by the following `Media Element`:term: s:

   *WebRTC with plateDetector filter Media Pipeline*

The complete source code of this demo can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-java/tree/master/kurento-platedetector>`_.

This example is a modified version of the
:doc:`Magic Mirror <./tutorial-magicmirror>` tutorial. In this case, this
demo uses a **PlateDetector** instead of **FaceOverlay** filter. An screenshot
of the running example is shown in the following picture:

.. note::

   Modules can have options. For configuring these options, you'll need to get the constructor for them.
   In Javascript and Node, you have to use *kurentoClient.getComplexType('qualifiedName')* . There is
   an example in the code.

The following snippet shows how the media pipeline is implemented in the Java
server-side code of the demo. An important issue in this code is that a
listener is added to the ``PlateDetectorFilter`` object
(``addPlateDetectedListener``). This way, each time a plate is detected in the
stream, a message is sent to the client side. As shown in the screenshot below,
this event is printed in the console of the GUI.

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    ...
    kurentoClient.register('kurento-module-platedetector')
    ...

    kurentoClient(args.ws_uri, function(error, client) {
      if (error) return onError(error);

      client.create('MediaPipeline', function(error, _pipeline) {
        if (error) return onError(error);

        pipeline = _pipeline;

        console.log("Got MediaPipeline");

        pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', function(error, webRtc) {
          if (error) return onError(error);

          console.log("Got WebRtcEndpoint");

          setIceCandidateCallbacks(webRtcPeer, webRtc, onError)

          webRtc.processOffer(sdpOffer, function(error, sdpAnswer) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("SDP answer obtained. Processing...");

            webRtc.gatherCandidates(onError);
            webRtcPeer.processAnswer(sdpAnswer);
          });

          pipeline.create('platedetector.PlateDetectorFilter', function(error, filter) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("Got Filter");

            filter.on('PlateDetected', function (data){
              console.log("License plate detected " + data.plate);
            });

            client.connect(webRtc, filter, webRtc, function(error) {
              if (error) return onError(error);

              console.log("WebRtcEndpoint --> filter --> WebRtcEndpoint");
            });
          });
        });
      });
    });

.. note::

   The :term:`TURN` and :term:`STUN` servers to be used can be configured simple adding
   the parameter ``ice_servers`` to the application URL, as follows:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"stun:stun1.example.net"},{"urls":"stun:stun2.example.net"}]
      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"turn:turn.example.org","username":"user","credential":"myPassword"}]
