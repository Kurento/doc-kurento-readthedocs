JavaScript Module - Pointer Detector Filter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application consists on a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*) with a pointer tracking filter element.

.. note::

   This tutorial has been configurated for using https. Follow these `instructions </features/security.html#configure-javascript-applications-to-use-https>`_ 
   for securing your application.

For the impatient: running this example
=======================================

First of all, you should install Kurento Media Server to run this demo. Please
visit the :doc:`installation guide </user/installation>` for further
information. In addition, the built-in module ``kms-pointerdetector``
should be also installed:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    sudo apt-get install kms-pointerdetector

Be sure to have installed `Node.js`:term: and `Bower`:term: in your system. In
an Ubuntu machine, you can install both as follows:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_4.x | sudo bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g bower

Due to `Same-origin policy`:term:, this demo has to be served by an HTTP server.
A very simple way of doing this is by means of an HTTP Node.js server which can
be installed using `npm`:term: :

.. sourcecode:: bash

   sudo npm install http-server -g

You also need the source code of this demo. You can clone it from GitHub. Then
start the HTTP server:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-js/kurento-pointerdetector
    git checkout |VERSION|
    bower install
    http-server -p 8443 -S -C keys/server.crt -K keys/server.key

Finally, access the application connecting to the URL https://localhost:8443/
through a WebRTC capable browser (Chrome, Firefox).

.. note::

   These instructions work only if Kurento Media Server is up and running in the same machine
   as the tutorial. Kurento Media Server must use WebSockets over SSL/TLS (WSS), so make sure
   you check `this <../../faq.html?highlight=wss#configure-kurento-media-server-to-use-secure-websocket-wss>`_ too. 
   It is possible to locate the KMS in other machine simple adding the parameter ``ws_uri`` to the URL:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ws_uri=wss://kms_host:kms_port/kurento

   Notice that the Kurento Media Server must connected using a **Secure WebSocket** (i.e., the KMS URI
   starts with *wss://*). For this reason, the support for secure WebSocket must be enabled in the Kurento
   Media Server you are using to run this tutorial. For further information about securing applications,
   please visit the following :doc:`page </features/security>`.

Understanding this example
==========================

This application uses computer vision and augmented reality techniques to detect
a pointer in a WebRTC stream based on color tracking.

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one for the video camera stream (the local client-side stream) and
other for the mirror (the remote stream). The video camera stream is sent to
Kurento Media Server, which processes and sends it back to the client as a
remote stream. To implement this, we need to create a `Media Pipeline`:term:
composed by the following `Media Element`:term: s:

   :align:   center
   :alt:     WebRTC with PointerDetector filter in loopback Media Pipeline

   *WebRTC with PointerDetector filter in loopback Media Pipeline*

The complete source code of this demo can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js/tree/master/kurento-pointerdetector>`_.

This example is a modified version of the
:doc:`Magic Mirror <./tutorial-magicmirror>` tutorial. In this case, this
demo uses a **PointerDetector** instead of **FaceOverlay** filter.

In order to perform pointer detection, there must be a calibration stage, in
which the color of the pointer is registered by the filter. To accomplish this
step, the pointer should be placed in a square in the upper left corner of the
video, as follows:

.. figure:: ../../images/kurento-module-tutorial-pointerdetector-screenshot-01.png
   :align:   center
   :alt:     Pointer calibration stage

   *Pointer calibration stage*

.. note::

   Modules can have options. For configuring these options, you'll need to get the constructor for them.
   In Javascript and Node, you have to use *kurentoClient.getComplexType('qualifiedName')* . There is 
   an example in the code.

In that precise moment, a calibration operation should be carried out. This is
done by clicking on the *Calibrate* blue button of the GUI.

After that, the color of the pointer is tracked in real time by Kurento Media
Server. ``PointerDetectorFilter`` can also define regions in the screen called
*windows* in which some actions are performed when the pointer is detected when
the pointer enters (``WindowIn`` event) and exits (``WindowOut`` event) the
windows. This is implemented in the JavaScript logic as follows:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    ...
    kurentoClient.register('kurento-module-pointerdetector')
    const PointerDetectorWindowMediaParam = kurentoClient.getComplexType('pointerdetector.PointerDetectorWindowMediaParam')
    const WindowParam                     = kurentoClient.getComplexType('pointerdetector.WindowParam')
    ...
    
    kurentoClient(args.ws_uri, function(error, client) {
      if (error) return onError(error);

      client.create('MediaPipeline', function(error, _pipeline) {
        if (error) return onError(error);

        pipeline = _pipeline;

        console.log("Got MediaPipeline");

        pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', function(error, webRtc) {
          if (error) return onError(error);

          console.log("Got WebRtcEndpoint");

          setIceCandidateCallbacks(webRtcPeer, webRtc, onError)

          webRtc.processOffer(sdpOffer, function(error, sdpAnswer) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("SDP answer obtained. Processing ...");

            webRtc.gatherCandidates(onError);
            webRtcPeer.processAnswer(sdpAnswer);
          });

          var options =
          {
            calibrationRegion: WindowParam({
              topRightCornerX: 5,
              topRightCornerY:5,
              width:30,
              height: 30
            })
          };

          pipeline.create('pointerdetector.PointerDetectorFilter', options, function(error, _filter) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            filter = _filter;

            var options = PointerDetectorWindowMediaParam({
              id: 'window0',
              height: 50,
              width:50,
              upperRightX: 500,
              upperRightY: 150
            });

            filter.addWindow(options, onError);

            var options = PointerDetectorWindowMediaParam({
              id: 'window1',
              height: 50,
              width:50,
              upperRightX: 500,
              upperRightY: 250
            });

            filter.addWindow(options, onError);

            filter.on ('WindowIn', function (data){
              console.log ("Event window in detected in window " + data.windowId);
            });

            filter.on ('WindowOut', function (data){
              console.log ("Event window out detected in window " + data.windowId);
            });

            console.log("Connecting ...");
            client.connect(webRtc, filter, webRtc, function(error) {
              if (error) return onError(error);

              console.log("WebRtcEndpoint --> Filter --> WebRtcEndpoint");
            });
          });
        });
      });
    });


The following picture illustrates the pointer tracking in one of the defined
windows:

.. figure:: ../../images/kurento-module-tutorial-pointerdetector-screenshot-02.png
   :align:   center
   :alt:     Pointer tracking over a window

   *Pointer tracking over a window*

In order to carry out the calibration process, this JavaScript function is used:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   function calibrate() {
     if(filter) filter.trackColorFromCalibrationRegion(onError);
   }

   function onError(error) {
     if(error) console.error(error);
   }

.. note::

   The :term:`TURN` and :term:`STUN` servers to be used can be configured simple adding
   the parameter ``ice_servers`` to the application URL, as follows:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"stun:stun1.example.net"},{"urls":"stun:stun2.example.net"}]
      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"turn:turn.example.org","username":"user","credential":"myPassword"}]
