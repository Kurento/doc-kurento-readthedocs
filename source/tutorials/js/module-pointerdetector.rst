JavaScript Module - Pointer Detector Filter
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

This web application consists on a `WebRTC`:term: video communication in mirror
(*loopback*) with a pointer tracking filter element.

.. note::

   This tutorial has been configurated for using https. Follow these `instructions </features/security.html#configure-javascript-applications-to-use-https>`_
   for securing your application.

For the impatient: running this example
=======================================

First of all, install Kurento Media Server: :doc:`/user/installation`.

.. note::

   If you will run this tutorial from a remote machine (i.e. not from ``localhost``), then **you need to configure Secure WebSocket (wss://) in Kurento Media Server**. For instructions, check :ref:`features-security-kms-wss`.

   This is not an issue if you will run both KMS and the tutorial demo locally, because browsers (at least Chrome at the time of this writing) allow connecting to insecure WebSockets from HTTPS pages, as long as everything happens in ``localhost``.

After getting a properly configured KMS installation, leave the media server running in the background.

Install :term:`Node.js` and :term:`Bower` in your system:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_8.x | sudo -E bash -
   sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
   sudo npm install -g bower

WebRTC requires HTTPS, so this tutorial demo must be served by a secure web server. You can use whichever one you prefer, such as Nginx or Apache. For quick tests, a very straightforward option is to use Node.js to run the simple, zero-configuration `http-server <https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server>`__:

.. sourcecode:: bash

   sudo npm install -g http-server

You also need the source code of this demo; clone it from GitHub, then start the web server:

.. sourcecode:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js.git
    cd kurento-tutorial-js/kurento-pointerdetector
    git checkout 6.10.0
    bower install
    http-server -p 8443 --ssl --cert keys/server.crt --key keys/server.key

Finally, access the web application by using a WebRTC-capable browser (Firefox, Chrome) to open the appropriate URL:

* If KMS is running in your local machine:

  .. code-block:: text

     https://localhost:8443/

* If KMS is running in a remote server:

  .. code-block:: text

     https://localhost:8443/index.html?ws_uri=wss://<KmsIp>:<KmsPort>/kurento

Understanding this example
==========================

This application uses computer vision and augmented reality techniques to detect
a pointer in a WebRTC stream based on color tracking.

The interface of the application (an HTML web page) is composed by two HTML5
video tags: one for the video camera stream (the local client-side stream) and
other for the mirror (the remote stream). The video camera stream is sent to
Kurento Media Server, which processes and sends it back to the client as a
remote stream. To implement this, we need to create a `Media Pipeline`:term:
composed by the following `Media Element`:term: s:

   *WebRTC with PointerDetector filter in loopback Media Pipeline*

The complete source code of this demo can be found in
`GitHub <https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-tutorial-js/tree/master/kurento-pointerdetector>`_.

This example is a modified version of the
:doc:`Magic Mirror <./tutorial-magicmirror>` tutorial. In this case, this
demo uses a **PointerDetector** instead of **FaceOverlay** filter.

In order to perform pointer detection, there must be a calibration stage, in
which the color of the pointer is registered by the filter. To accomplish this
step, the pointer should be placed in a square in the upper left corner of the
video, as follows:

.. figure:: ../../images/kurento-module-tutorial-pointerdetector-screenshot-01.png
   :align:   center
   :alt:     Pointer calibration stage

   *Pointer calibration stage*

.. note::

   Modules can have options. For configuring these options, you'll need to get the constructor for them.
   In Javascript and Node, you have to use *kurentoClient.getComplexType('qualifiedName')* . There is
   an example in the code.

In that precise moment, a calibration operation should be carried out. This is
done by clicking on the *Calibrate* blue button of the GUI.

After that, the color of the pointer is tracked in real time by Kurento Media
Server. ``PointerDetectorFilter`` can also define regions in the screen called
*windows* in which some actions are performed when the pointer is detected when
the pointer enters (``WindowIn`` event) and exits (``WindowOut`` event) the
windows. This is implemented in the JavaScript logic as follows:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

    ...
    kurentoClient.register('kurento-module-pointerdetector')
    const PointerDetectorWindowMediaParam = kurentoClient.getComplexType('pointerdetector.PointerDetectorWindowMediaParam')
    const WindowParam                     = kurentoClient.getComplexType('pointerdetector.WindowParam')
    ...

    kurentoClient(args.ws_uri, function(error, client) {
      if (error) return onError(error);

      client.create('MediaPipeline', function(error, _pipeline) {
        if (error) return onError(error);

        pipeline = _pipeline;

        console.log("Got MediaPipeline");

        pipeline.create('WebRtcEndpoint', function(error, webRtc) {
          if (error) return onError(error);

          console.log("Got WebRtcEndpoint");

          setIceCandidateCallbacks(webRtcPeer, webRtc, onError)

          webRtc.processOffer(sdpOffer, function(error, sdpAnswer) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            console.log("SDP answer obtained. Processing ...");

            webRtc.gatherCandidates(onError);
            webRtcPeer.processAnswer(sdpAnswer);
          });

          var options =
          {
            calibrationRegion: WindowParam({
              topRightCornerX: 5,
              topRightCornerY:5,
              width:30,
              height: 30
            })
          };

          pipeline.create('pointerdetector.PointerDetectorFilter', options, function(error, _filter) {
            if (error) return onError(error);

            filter = _filter;

            var options = PointerDetectorWindowMediaParam({
              id: 'window0',
              height: 50,
              width:50,
              upperRightX: 500,
              upperRightY: 150
            });

            filter.addWindow(options, onError);

            var options = PointerDetectorWindowMediaParam({
              id: 'window1',
              height: 50,
              width:50,
              upperRightX: 500,
              upperRightY: 250
            });

            filter.addWindow(options, onError);

            filter.on ('WindowIn', function (data){
              console.log ("Event window in detected in window " + data.windowId);
            });

            filter.on ('WindowOut', function (data){
              console.log ("Event window out detected in window " + data.windowId);
            });

            console.log("Connecting ...");
            client.connect(webRtc, filter, webRtc, function(error) {
              if (error) return onError(error);

              console.log("WebRtcEndpoint --> Filter --> WebRtcEndpoint");
            });
          });
        });
      });
    });


The following picture illustrates the pointer tracking in one of the defined
windows:

   :alt:     Pointer tracking over a window

   *Pointer tracking over a window*

In order to carry out the calibration process, this JavaScript function is used:

.. sourcecode:: javascript

   function calibrate() {
     if(filter) filter.trackColorFromCalibrationRegion(onError);
   }

   function onError(error) {
     if(error) console.error(error);
   }

.. note::

   The :term:`TURN` and :term:`STUN` servers to be used can be configured simple adding
   the parameter ``ice_servers`` to the application URL, as follows:

   .. sourcecode:: bash

      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"stun:stun1.example.net"},{"urls":"stun:stun2.example.net"}]
      https://localhost:8443/index.html?ice_servers=[{"urls":"turn:turn.example.org","username":"user","credential":"myPassword"}]
