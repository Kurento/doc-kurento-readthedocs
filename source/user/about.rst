About Kurento and WebRTC
========================

:term:`Kurento` is a :term:`WebRTC` Media Server and a set of client APIs that simplify the development of advanced video applications for web and smartphone platforms. Its features include group communications, transcoding, recording, mixing, broadcasting and routing of audiovisual flows.

Kurento offers a multimedia framework that eases the task of building multimedia applications with the following features:

- **Dynamic WebRTC Media pipelines**: Kurento allows custom :ref:`media pipelines <writing-app-pipelines>` connected to WebRTC peers like web browsers and mobile apps. These media pipelines are based on composable elements such as players, recorders, mixers, etc. that can be mix-and-matched, activated, or deactivated at any point in time, even when the media is already flowing.

- **Client/Server Architecture**: Apps developed with Kurento follow a client/server architecture. Kurento Media Server (KMS) is the server and offers a WebSocket interface implementing the Kurento Protocol, which allows Client Applications to define pipeline topologies.

- **Java and JavaScript Client Applications**: The typical use case of a KMS deployment consists of a three-layer architecture, where the user's browser interacts with the KMS server by means of an intermediate Client Application. There are several official Kurento Client Libraries, supporting the use of Java and JavaScript for the Client Applications. Clients for other languages can be easily implemented following the WebSocket protocol.

- **Third party Modules**: The Kurento Media Server has an extensible architecture based on plugins, which allows third parties to implement modules that can be added to their media pipelines. This allows integration of media processing algorithms to any WebRTC application, like integrating Computer Vision, Augmented Reality, video indexing, and speech analysis. All is needed is to create a new Kurento element, and use it in any already existing media pipeline.

This document contains a high level explanation of how to become a KMS developer. Development of *Kurento Client Applications* is out of the scope for this document, and won't be explained here.

WebRTC media servers
====================

`WebRTC <https://webrtc.org/>`__ is a set of protocols, mechanisms and APIs that provide browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities over peer-to-peer connections. It has been conceived as a technology that allows browsers to communicate directly without the mediation of any kind of infrastructure. However, this model is only enough for creating basic web applications; features such as group communications, media stream recording, media broadcasting, or media transcoding are difficult to implement on top of it. For this reason, many applications end up requiring an intermediate media server.

   *Peer-to-peer WebRTC approach vs. WebRTC through a media server*

Conceptually, a WebRTC media server is just a multimedia middleware where media traffic passes through when moving from source to destinations.

Media servers are capable of processing incoming media streams and offer different outcomes, such as:

- Group Communications: Distributing among several receivers the media stream that one peer generates, i.e. acting as a Multi-Conference Unit ("MCU").
- Mixing: Transforming several incoming stream into one single composite stream.
- Transcoding: On-the-fly adaptation of codecs and formats between incompatible clients.
- Recording: Storing in a persistent way the media exchanged among peers.

Kurento Media Server
====================

Kurento's main component is the **Kurento Media Server** (KMS), responsible for media transmission, processing, recording, and playback. KMS is built on top of the fantastic :term:`GStreamer` multimedia library, and provides the following features:

-  Networked streaming protocols, including :term:`HTTP`, :term:`RTP` and :term:`WebRTC`.
-  Group communications (MCU and SFU functionality) supporting both media mixing and media routing/dispatching.
-  Generic support for filters implementing Computer Vision and Augmented Reality algorithms.
-  Media storage that supports writing operations for :term:`WebM` and :term:`MP4` and playing in all formats supported by *GStreamer*.
-  Automatic media transcoding between any of the codecs supported by GStreamer, including VP8, H.264, H.263, AMR, OPUS, Speex, G.711, and more.

Kurento Design Principles
=========================

Kurento is designed based on the following main principles:

    **Separate Media and Signaling Planes**
        :term:`Signaling <signaling plane>` and :term:`Media <media plane>` are two separate planes and Kurento is designed so that applications can handle separately those facets of multimedia processing.

    **Distribution of Media and Application Services**
        Kurento Media Server and applications can be collocated, escalated or distributed among different machines.

        A single application can invoke the services of more than one Kurento Media Server. The opposite also applies, that is, a  Kurento Media Server can attend the requests of more than one application.

    **Suitable for the Cloud**
        Kurento is suitable to be integrated into cloud environments to act as a PaaS (Platform as a Service) component.

    **Media Pipelines**
        Chaining :term:`Media Elements <Media Element>` via :term:`Media Pipelines <Media Pipeline>` is an intuitive approach to challenge the complexity of multimedia processing.

    **Application development**
        Developers do not need to be aware of internal Kurento Media Server complexities: all the applications can deployed in any technology or framework the developer likes, from client to server. From browsers to cloud services.

    **End-to-End Communication Capability**
        Kurento provides end-to-end communication capabilities so developers do not need to deal with the complexity of transporting, encoding/decoding and rendering media on client devices.

    **Fully Processable Media Streams**
       Kurento enables not only interactive interpersonal communications (e.g. Skype-like with conversational call push/reception capabilities), but also human-to-machine (e.g. Video on Demand through real-time streaming) and machine-to-machine (e.g. remote video recording, multisensory data exchange) communications.

    **Modular Processing of Media**
       Modularization achieved through :term:`media elements <Media Element>` and :term:`pipelines <Media Pipeline>` allows defining the media processing functionality of an application through a "graph-oriented" language, where the application developer is able to create the desired logic by chaining the appropriate functionalities.

    **Auditable Processing**
        Kurento is able to generate rich and detailed information for QoS monitoring, billing and auditing.

    **Seamless IMS integration**
        Kurento is designed to support seamless integration into the :term:`IMS` infrastructure of Telephony Carriers.

    **Transparent Media Adaptation Layer**
        Kurento provides a transparent media adaptation layer to make the convergence among different devices having different requirements in terms of screen size, power consumption, transmission rate, etc. possible.
